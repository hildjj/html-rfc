Internet-Draft               HTML RFC Format                   July 2012


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Background

   If you are viewing a version of this document other than the HTML
   generated by the editor, your a missing vital information.  Download
   a canonical version from
   http://cursive.net/draft-hildebrand-html-rfc-2012-07-16.html.

   The RFC Series has been in existence for over 40 years.  During much
   of that time, the limitations of character set, line and page length,
   and graphics restrictions of RFC documents met the most immediate
   needs of the majority of authors and readers.  As technology changed,
   new formats that allowed for a richer set of edit, search and display
   features came in to use, and tools were created to convert the plain
   ASCII documents to other desired formats such as HTML, PDF, and
   Microsoft Word.  While the converted versions of the RFCs are widely
   available, the canonical display format remains the plain text,
   ASCII, line-printer structured one.  The canonical source format is
   nroff.

   Canonical source and display versions of an RFC exists for several
   reasons:

   o  to provide verification of the content of an RFC in case
      inconsistencies are created when a document is converted to
      another format or mirrored to another location
   o  to verify the final content of a document in cases of legal
      dispute
   o  to aid in the conversion of the RFC in to formats requested by the
      community

   The current basic format of RFC source and display documents have two
   characteristics that are considered by the RFC Series Editor to be
   critical to the RFC Series, including:

   o  persistence (tools to read, edit, and print the documents remain
      easily accessible to everyone)
   o  convertibility (the plain text version is simple to convert to
      other formats)

   That said, the very simple nature of the current display format in
   particular introduces a variety of limitations, the list of which has
   grown as changes in technology create new expectations:

   o  ASCII art is considered by some to be a major limitation in
      expressing visually-oriented information




Hildebrand              Expires January 17, 2013                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               HTML RFC Format                   July 2012


   o  the internationalization of the authorship and the Internet is
      introducing Unicode [8] codepoints not expressible in 7-bit ASCII
   o  the more common forms of display (web pages, smaller devices) make
      the limitations of page and line length a hindrance to the reading
      of an RFC
   o  tools for people with visual impairments may stumble over the
      page-oriented structure of the current format; large fonts on a
      screen that is not large enough to show an entire line, for
      example, can make the current format difficult to read, since
      lines do not re-wrap automatically

1.2.  Overview

   This memo describes a format that can be used both as the canonical
   input format to the RFC Series Editor (RSE), as well as an archival
   format.  Some document authors will write documents directly in this
   format (perhaps with tooling to generate the more repetitive tasks),
   and some authors will prefer other formats as their original source,
   all of which MUST be able to generate the format described in this
   memo.

   This memo has the following goals:

   1.  Define a strict subset of HTML appropriate for Internet-Draft and
       RFC Series documents
   2.  Serve as a comprehensive example of all of the HTML elements that
       are permissible

1.3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [2].


2.  Accessibility

   One of the major goals of the HTML format is to ensure accessibility
   for the following consumers of documents written in the format:

   o  People with impaired vision, including those that use large fonts
      and those that use screen readers
   o  People with difficulty distinguishing between colors
   o  People who use devices with small screens, such as cell phones
   o  Other groups TBD

   Specific instances where these goals are important in the design

Internet-Draft               HTML RFC Format                   July 2012


   choices of the format have been called out in the text.

   NOTE:  designing for these consumers does not preclude the use of
   features they cannot use, but does require that key semantic data is
   not lost when read using the tools and settings that are required by
   a given constituency.


3.  HTML Format

   The format specified here is a subset of HTML, deemed to be widely-
   implemented by common browsers at the time that the specification was
   created, likely to continue to be widely-implemented in the future,
   and unlikely to cause security issues.

3.1.  Syntax

   The following rules SHALL be enforced before submittal.

   o  The HTML source MUST be encoded as UTF-8, as specified in RFC3629
      [4].
   o  The HTML source MUST be formatted in the manner of well-formed XML
      [11], with all element start tags having matching end tags (or
      "<element />" for empty elements), and all elements properly
      nested.  HTML "boolean" attributes MUST be formatted in the
      "attr='attr'" style.
   o  Single quotes (U+0027 APOSTROPHE:  "'") MUST be used to quote
      attribute values.  Unquoted attribute values MUST NOT be used.
   o  HTML SHALL be indented using spaces (not tabs).
   o  Each child element SHALL be indented two spaces more than its
      parent element, unless the child element is mixed with non-
      whitespace-only text children of the same parent element.
   o  Each logical line MUST be terminated solely with a \n (U+000A:
      LINE FEED), otherwise known as "Unix-style" line endings.
   o  Other than \n (U+000A:  LINE FEED), code points less than " "
      (U+0020:  SPACE) (otherwise known as "control characters") MUST
      NOT be used.  Any character references that would generate these
      code points (e.g. ) MUST NOT be used.  NOTE:  this rule explicitly
      forbids \t (U+0009:  CHARACTER TABULATION), \f (U+000C:  FORM
      FEED), and \r (U+000D:  CARRIAGE RETURN) from appearing in the
      source.
   o  Unicode codepoints that are unassigned at the time of publication
      MUST not be used.
   o  Any Unicode codepoint higher than ~ (U+007E:  TILDE) MUST serve an
      explicit purpose that enhances the understanding of the document.
      Author names and examples are two known cases.  The intent is that
      the document MUST be understandable by a reader with the ability
      to read technical English.

Internet-Draft               HTML RFC Format                   July 2012


   o  Each text-containing element such as headings ("<h1>"-"<h6>"),
      paragraphs ("<p>"), or list items ("<li>"), MUST be serialized as
      a single line without wrapping.

   NOTE:  none of these rules affect the rendered output of the HTML,
   but are intended to increase the chance that multiple tools that
   process the format will generate identical syntax.  In turn, this
   will make difference tools that operate on the HTML source easier to
   write.

3.2.  Basic Structure

3.2.1.  HTML5

   The HTML comprising the document MUST be valid according to the
   latest version of the HTML specification at the publishing, starting
   with the version commonly known as HTML5 [12].  Although the HTML
   specification mandates several of syntax and structure rules in this
   document, they are called out here for emphasis.

3.2.2.  DOCTYPE

   The DOCTYPE of the document MUST be "html", which declares that the
   document is compliant with HTML5 [12].  For example, the document
   will start with exactly this string:
   <!DOCTYPE html>

3.2.3.  Root Element

   The root element of the document MUST be "<html>".  This element
   SHOULD include a "lang" attribute, whose value is a RFC5646 [7]
   language tag describing the natural language of the document.  For
   documents submitted to the RFC Series or Internet-Draft Series, the
   language tag MUST be ""en"", meaning "English".  If the "lang"
   attribute is not present, its value should be taken to be ""en"".

3.2.4.  Charset Declaration

   In order to be correctly processed by browsers that load the HTML
   using a mechanism that does not provide a valid MIME content-type or
   charset, the HTML "<head>" element MUST contain a "<meta>" element,
   with the attributes "http-equiv='Content-Type'" and
   "content='text/html; charset=utf-8'".  This will look like:
   <meta http-equiv='Content-Type' content='text/html; charset=utf-8' />

Internet-Draft               HTML RFC Format                   July 2012


3.2.5.  Style

   The "<head>" SHOULD contain an embedded CSS [9] stylesheet in a
   "<style>" element.  The styles in the stylesheet are to be set
   consistently between documents by the RFC Editor, according to the
   best practices of the day.  The RFC Editor SHALL choose a stylesheet
   that does not modify the meaning of the normative text of the
   document.  The RFC Editor SHALL make the stylesheet available via a
   standard protocol (e.g.  HTTP or HTTPS) for ease of authorship.
   However, when a document is submitted, external stylesheets (other
   than "local.css" as specified below) are NOT ALLOWED.  The stylesheet
   itself MUST NOT be considered as normative information.

   To ensure consistent formatting, individual "style" attributes SHOULD
   NOT be used in the main portion of the document source except in
   highly exceptional circumstances; each use MUST be individually
   justified.

   Different readers of a specification will desire different tweaks to
   the stylesheet.  To facilitate this, the "<head>" SHOULD include a
   "<link>" to a stylesheet in the same directory as the HTML file,
   named "local.css", *after* the embedded stylesheet.  Note that this
   "local.css" file will not exist for most users; browsers will
   correspondingly ignore this "<link>".  When the document is used
   canonically, these local style overrides MUST NOT be in effect.

   For example:

   <head>
     <style type='text/css'>
   <!--
   /* RFC-editor styles */
   -->
     </style>
     <link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='local.css' />
   </head>

3.2.6.  Emphasis

   Words or phrases may be emphasized using the "<strong>" element for
   "*bold*", and the "<em>" element for "_italics_".  Underlining MUST
   NOT be used except for links, to avoid visual confusion.  Text-only
   emphasis MUST NOT be used.

   The RFC Editor will set a policy that reflects the current feelings
   of the community as to whether this emphasis markup is allowed in
   documents that are submitted for publication in the RFC series.

3.2.7.  Comments

   HTML comments MAY be used, but MUST NOT contain normative
   information.  One example is to clarify particular choices in the
   HTML format.  Example:
   <!-- Automatically generated: do not modify -->

3.2.8.  Sections

   Each section of the document SHALL be formatted as a "<div>" tag,
   with a class attribute with value "section".  A document-unique, "id"
   attribute SHOULD be assigned to each section "<div>".  The "id" MAY
   be human-readable or generated.

   NOTE:  XML [11] requires id attributes to be unique across an entire
   document:

   Each section "<div>" MUST contain a header tag ("<h2>"-"<h6>") of the
   appropriate depth, with top-level sections getting an "<h2>" tag, and
   each nested section getting the next higher header level.  If more
   than five levels of headers are required, "<h6>" MUST be used for
   each deeper-nested section.  However, nesting sections more than five
   levels deep is NOT RECOMMENDED.

   The text in each header tag MUST begin with the section number.
   Section numbers MUST begin at "1.", and MUST increment by one for
   each successive section at the same level.  Subsections MUST be
   numbered by appending the subsection number to the parent section
   number.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the section number be wrapped in an "<a>"
   element, whose "href" attribute points to the corresponding section
   div with a local relative reference.  This "<a>" element SHOULD have
   the CSS class "self-ref".

   Within a section, each "normal" paragraph MUST be surrounded by a
   "<p>" element.

   For example:

 <div class='section' id='example'>
   <h2><a class='self-ref' href='#example'>1.</a> Example Section</h2>
   <p>This is a description of the example</p>
   <div class='section' id='nested'>
     <h3><a class='self-ref' href='#nested'>1.1.</a> Nested Section</h3>
     <p>This is a description of the nested section.</p>
     <p>This is the second description paragraph.</p>
   </div>

 </div>

3.2.9.  Appendices

   Appendices are special cases of top-level sections.  Each appendix of
   the document SHALL be formatted as a "<div>" tag, with a class
   attribute with value "appendix".  A document-unique, id attribute
   SHOULD be assigned to each section "<div>".  The id MAY be human-
   readable or generated.  Each appendix "<div>" MUST contain an "<h2>"
   element containing text that describes the purpose of the appendix.
   Appendices are identified to the reader with Latin capital letters
   A-Z, in order.  It is NOT RECOMMENDED to have more than 26
   appendices, but if required, appendices "AA.", "AB.", etc. follow
   Appendix Z.

   Inside the appendix, subsections MUST be formatted per Sections
   (Section 3.2.8), numbered sequentially.  For example, the first
   subsection of "Appendix A."  is "Appendix A.1.".

   For example:

   <div class='appendix' id='acknowledgements'>
     <h2>Appendix A. Acknowledgements</h2>
     <p>The author gratefully acknowledges the contributions of...</p>
     <div class='section' id='contributors'>
       <h3>Appendix A.1. Contributors</h2>
       <p>These people contributed text...</p>
     </div>
   </div>

3.2.10.  Paragraphs

   Paragraphs MUST be contained in a section (Section 3.2.8) "<div>" or
   an appendix (Section 3.2.9) "<div>".  A document-unique, "id"
   attribute SHOULD be assigned to each "<p>".  The "id" will usually be
   machine-generated, but MAY be human-readable if desired.

   It is RECOMMENDED that each paragraph be kept relatively small
   compared to a "page" in previous RFC formats, so that references to
   each paragraph are at least as valuable as page references have been
   in previous formats.

3.2.11.  Lists

   Lists may be used inside a section "<div>", and may nest in other
   lists as needed.  However, lists MUST NOT be nested inside a "<p>"
   element.  Unordered lists ("<ul>") and ordered lists ("<ol>") may
   both be used.  For example:

     </ul>
   </div>

3.2.12.  References

3.2.12.1.  Internal References

   References to other paragraphs or sections in the same document MUST
   use an "<a>" element with an "href" attribute with a fragment that
   points at the "id" attribute of the target (i.e. the "id" prefixed
   with a "#").  The target element MUST have a human-readable "id"
   attribute, which MUST be stable even when tooling generates new "id"
   attributes.  For example:
   See <a href='#example'>Example Section</a> for more details

3.2.12.2.  References to Standards

   References to standards are special, in that they generate formal
   bibliographical metadata.  All links to standards in the main body of
   the text MUST jump to the bibliographical (Section 4.6) entry; the
   href MUST be of the form #[series]:[number].  For example:
   href='#RFC2119'

   Valid series identifiers include:

   o  3gpp:  The 3rd Generation Partnership Project [16]
   o  ansi:  American National Standards Institute [17]
   o  ccitt:  ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector [18]
   o  fips:  Federal Information Processing Standard [19]
   o  id:  Internet-Drafts [20]

   o  rfc:  Request For Comments [27]
   o  w3c:  The World Wide Web Consortium [28]
   o  xep:  XMPP Standards Foundation [29]

   The text inside the link SHOULD be a human-readable colloquial
   representation of the standard name and/or number.

   Normative references MUST use "<a>" elements with class "ref".
   Example:
   See: <a class='ref' href='#RFC2119'>RFC2119</a>

   Informative references MUST use "<a>" elements with class "inforef".
   Example:
   See: <a class='inforef' href='#RFC2119'>RFC2119</a>

3.2.12.3.  Other External References

   References to other documents that are not standards SHOULD be linked
   using the "http:" or "https:" URI scheme, and MUST be linked using a
   a URI scheme that is widely-deployed at the time that the document is
   published, and which does not raise any security or stability issues.
   In particular, "javascript:" references MUST NOT be used.  Links
   using the "mailto:" scheme SHOULD be limited to the author's address
   information.

   For example:
   <a href='http://example.com/'>Example</a>

3.3.  More Elaborate Information

   This section describes how to format several types of information
   that occur regularly in documents for the Internet-Draft and RFC
   Series which are not descriptive text.

3.3.1.  Requirement Keywords

   The RFC2119 [2] keywords in the document MAY be set off with special
   markup.  If so, they MUST be surrounded with a "<span>" element
   continaing the CSS class "rfc2119".  For example:

   If so, they <span class='rfc2119'>MUST</span> be surrounded

3.3.2.  Sections to be Removed by the RFC Editor

   The author may want to inject notes to the reader that are not to be
   a part of the final document that is published by the RFC editor.
   These notes MAY use any format desired by the author that would
   otherwise be legal in the document, but the outermost element of the

Internet-Draft               HTML RFC Format                   July 2012


   note MUST have a CSS "class" with value "rfceditor-remove".

   <div class='rfceditor-remove'>
     <h2>Editorial Notes</h2>
     <p>...</p>
   </div>

3.3.3.  Formatting the Table of Contents

   The table of contents for the document MUST appear in a "<div>"
   element, which SHOULD precede any of the sections (Section 3.2.8) of
   proper document content.  The "<div>" element MUST have an "id"
   attribute with value "toc".  The "<div>" element SHOULD contain an
   "<h2>" element containing the string "Table of Contents", followed by
   nested "<ul>" and "<li>" elements describing the structure of the
   document, with links to each of the sections (Section 3.2.8)
   mentioned.  For example:

   <div id='toc'>
     <h2>Table of Contents</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>
         <div>1. <a href='#introduction'>Introduction</a></div>
         <ul>
           <li>
             <div>1.1. <a href='#background'>Background</a></div>
           </li>
           ...

   NOTE:  the Table of Contents SHOULD NOT be considered meta-data for
   the document.  The sections (Section 3.2.8) themselves SHOULD contain
   all of the data that is required.

3.3.4.  Images

   Include an image using the "<img>" tag with a "src" attribute.
   During the editing process, it may be useful to keep the value of the
   "src" attribute as a file name relative to the document, or a http(s)
   URL.  However, upon submission, the final version of a document SHALL
   include a "data:" URI as specified in RFC2397 [3].

   The image MIME type of the image SHALL be "image/png", as specified
   in RFC2083 [1].  The RFC Editor can allow other image types in the
   future, at the Editor's discretion, as the state of the art and
   common implementation patterns change.

   Consider how images will look when printed.  Consider how your images
   will be used by vision-impaired readers, including those readers with



Hildebrand              Expires January 17, 2013               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft               HTML RFC Format                   July 2012


   color vision deficiency.  For example, images SHOULD NOT have
   meaningful distinctions conveyed only by color differences, and
   images SHOULD be available in high enough resolution that readers
   with other vision deficiencies can zoom in to see detail.  Images
   MUST NOT be animated.

   The "alt" attribute is REQUIRED, and MUST be a complete, accessible
   description of the image.

   The "height" and "width" attributes SHOULD be used to specify the
   size of the image in pixels.

   Images MUST be wrapped in a "<figure>" element.  The "<figure>"
   element SHOULD contain a "<figcaption>" element after the "<img>"
   element, which SHOULD contain text that describes the image.  For
   example:

   <figure>
     <img src='data:image/png;base64,[BASE64-encoded PNG]'
          alt='A description of the diagram'
          width='236'
          height='176'/>
     <figcaption>Possible workflow for processing HTML RFCs</figcaption>
   </figure>

   Images SHOULD NOT be normative.  Instead, the information contained
   in the image SHOULD be adequately conveyed in the textual description
   that accompanies the image.

3.3.5.  SVG

   SVG [10] can be included directly in the HTML source, surrounded by a
   "<figure>" element and succeeded by a "<figcaption>" element, as
   described in Section 3.3.4 (Section 3.3.4).  The root "<svg>" element
   MUST contain a "<title>" or "<desc>" element that fully describes the
   diagram for accessibility to screen readers; this is similar to the
   "alt" attribute on images.  For example:

   <figure id='fig-2'>
     <svg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'>
       <title>A sample SVG</title>
       <desc>This is a sample image, with a title and description</desc>
       ...
     </svg>
     <figcaption>Sample SVG</figcaption>
   </figure>

   Might render as:



Hildebrand              Expires January 17, 2013               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft               HTML RFC Format                   July 2012


   Note that there are currently more browsers that can deal with
   "<img>" elements (or their "alt" text) than are able to generate any
   sensible fallback rendering from SVG.  Until this changes, authors
   might consider replacing their SVG with a rendered image.

3.3.6.  Inline Code

   Use the "<code>" element to set aside literal references to code or
   protocol elements in the middle of a paragraph.  If desired, the
   language of the code or protocol can be declared using a "class"
   attribute starting with "language-".  For example:
   Use the <code class='language-html'>&lt;code&gt;</code> element

3.3.7.  Blocks of Code

   Larger sections of code or protocol can be included using a "<pre>"
   element with a "class" attribute of "code".  If desired, the language
   of the code or protocol can be declared using a further "class" value
   starting with "language-" (multiple "class" values are separated by
   spaces in HTML).  The text inside the "<pre>" element will be
   rendered in a monospace font, with whitespace maintained.  For
   example:
   <pre class='code language-html'>
   &lt;html&gt;
     &lt;body /&gt;
   &lt;/html&gt;
   </pre>

   Will be rendered as:
   <html>
     <body />
   </html>

   Depending on author style, blocks of code MAY be enclosed in a
   "<figure>" element, with a "<figcaption>" element that describes the
   block.  For example, see Figure 3.

3.3.8.  ASCII Art

   ASCII art is still preferred by some authors in preference to an
   image or SVG.  The RFC Editor may decide to prefer images
   (Section 3.3.4) or SVG [10], or may decide to prohibit ASCII art in
   the future, depending on the needs of the community at the time of
   publishing.  Until that time, to include ASCII art, wrap a "<pre>"
   element with "class='ascii'" in a "<figure>" along with a
   "<figcaption>", as if the "<pre>" element were an image, as specified
   in the Section 3.3.4 (Section 3.3.4).  For example:

   <figure>
     <pre class='ascii'>
                     +-----------+
                     | original  | &lt;+
                     +-----------+  |
                       |            |
                       | nit        | edit
                       v            |
       nit (no-op)   +-----------+  |

     +-------------&gt; |           | -+
                     +-----------+
     </pre>
     <figcaption>Sample ASCII art</figcaption>
   </figure>

3.3.9.  Packet Formats

   Packet format descriptions can be encoded as a "<table>" element
   wrapped in a "<figure>" along with a "<figcaption>", as if the
   "<pre>" element were an image, as specified in Section 3.3.4
   (Section 3.3.4).  For consistent formatting, the "<table>" element
   should have class "pdu".  For example:

   <figure>
     <figcaption>Sample packet format</figcaption>
     <table class='pdu'> [table describing the packet] </table>
   </figure>

   Would be rendered as:


4.  Document Metadata

   Metadata for the document SHOULD be easily extractable from the
   document by tools that ordinarily process HTML.  Typically, the
   "class" and "id" attributes can be used to query the document using
   CSS [9]-style selectors.  The metadata scheme SHOULD be designed such
   that the element name is not required in order to select a given
   piece of data.  Instead, any element that can contain text can be
   used for a given "class" or "id" to be selected.  The value of the
   data contained by the selected element(s) consists of the
   concatenation of all of the text from all of the child nodes of the
   selected element or elements, with each run of consecutive whitespace
   Unicode codepoints [codepoints with the White_Space property, such as
   U+0020 (SPACE), U+0009 (CHARACTER TABULATION), U+000A (LINE FEED),
   U+000C (FORM FEED), U+000D (CARRIAGE RETURN), U+00A0 (NON-BREAKING



Hildebrand              Expires January 17, 2013               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft               HTML RFC Format                   July 2012


   SPACE), and U+2029 (PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR)] compressed to a single
   U+0020 (SPACE).  The metadata scheme MUST allow unambiguous
   selection.

   The "id" attribute is used to identify pieces of data that are
   guaranteed to be unique across the document.  Any element with an
   "id" attribute can also be used as a fragment target in a URI by
   starting with the base URI of the document, then appending "#"
   (U+0023:  NUMBER SIGN) and the value of the "id" attribute.  In CSS,
   the element with a given "id" attribute value is selected by
   prepending the value with "#" (U+0023:  NUMBER SIGN).  For example,
   the following HTML in a document with the URI
   "http://example.com/index.html":
   <div id='example'>Important Text</div>

   Can be targeted directly with the URL
   "http://example.com/index.html#example", and the CSS selector
   "#example".

   The "class" attribute is a catch-all tagging mechanism for everything
   in the document that might not be unique.  Multiple classes may be
   defined on a single element by setting the "class" attribute to a
   space-separated list of classes.  All of the elements with a given
   class name can be selected in CSS by prepending the class name with
   "."  (U+002E:  FULL STOP).

4.1.  Document Information

   Information about the document as a whole.  The "<div>" element with
   "id='document'" SHOULD be the first child element of the HTML body.
   For example:

   <div id='document'>
     <div class='identifiers'>
       <div class='workgroup'>Network Working Group</div>
       <div class='series'>Internet-Draft</div>
       <div class='status'>Standards Track</div>
       <div class='published'>2012-07-07</div>
       <div class='expires'>2013-01-07</div>
       <div class='version'>00</div>
     </div>
     <div class='authors'>
       <div class='author'>
         <span class='initial'>J.</span>
         <span class='surname'>Hildebrand</span>
         <span class='company'>Cisco Systems, Inc.</span>
       </div>
     </div>

   </div>

   More details for this format will be included in future drafts of
   this document.

4.2.  Title

   The title of the document MUST appear in an "<h1>" element, which
   SHOULD follow dirctly after the Document Information (Section 4.1).
   The "<h1>" element MUST have an "id" attribute with value "title".
   For example:

   <h1 id='title'>HTML RFC Format</h1>

4.3.  Abstract

   The abstract for the document MUST appear in a "<div>" element, which
   SHOULD follow directly after the Title (Section 4.2).  The "<div>"
   element MUST have an "id" attribute with value "abstract".  The
   "<div>" element SHOULD contain an "<h2>" element containing the word
   "Abstract", and MUST contain one or more "<p>" elements contianing
   text that describes the document succintly.  For example:

   <div id='abstract'>
     <h2>Abstract</h2>
     <p>This document defines an HTML format...</p>
   </div>

4.4.  IPR Statements

   The IPR boilerplate for the document MUST appear in a "<div>"
   element, which SHOULD follow directly after the Abstract
   (Section 4.3).  The "<div>" element MUST have an "id" attribute with
   value "ipr" and a CSS "class" of the name of the relevant IPR
   ruleset.  The only valid values for the IPR ruleset class are
   "trust200902", "noModificationTrust200902", and
   "noDerivativesTrust200902" at this time.  The contents of the "<div>"
   element are to be set correctly for the given ruleset, based on
   guidance from the IETF trust.  For example:

   <div id='ipr' class='trust200902'>
     <h2>Status of this Memo</h2>
     <p>...</p>
     <h2>Copyright Notice</h2>
     <p>...</p>
   </div>

   Question:  should the valid IPR classes be put in an IANA registry

   along with their boilerplate expansions?

4.5.  Author

   NOTE:  this document currently uses the approach specified by
   "hCard [30]".  The author recommends that the vcarddav [31] Working
   Group of the IETF be tasked to propose an approach for HTML embedding
   of vCard that is aligned with RFC 6350 [14].  In particular, the
   "language" and "altid" mechanisms of RFC 6350 [14] are not explicitly
   mentioned in hCard, and are required in order to fit the desire for
   authors' names to be representable both by English readers as well as
   the native language of the author.

   This section will be augmented with normative text when an approach
   is decided upon.  A quick example (as an existence proof) can be
   found in Figure 6.  The rendered version can be found in the authors
   section for this document.

4.6.  Bibliographical Information

   TBD:  define microformat for bibliographical data, perhaps based on
   the citation [32] work at microformats.org [33].


5.  Examples

5.1.  Self

   This draft itself is a good example of how to use the format.  Please
   view-source.

5.2.  Code Sample

   #include <stdio.h>
   int main(int argc, char **argv)
   {
       printf("Hello, IETF\n");
       return 0;
   }

5.3.  Sequence Diagrams

   Include an image tag with "class='sequence'", where the alt text is
   the WebSequenceDiagrams.com [34] source for the diagram.

   Before publication, this approach will be replaced by something more
   well-specified and not requiring third-party software.

   Alice-&gt;Bob: Authentication Request
   note right of Bob: Bob thinks about it
   Bob-&gt;Alice: Authentication Response' />
     <figcaption>A sample sequence diagram</figcaption>
   </figure>

5.4.  ABNF

   Augmented Backus-Naur Form is a way of describing formal syntax,
   described in RFC5234 [13].  Include ABNF (without extra indentation)
   in a "<pre>" element, with CSS class "code" and "language-abnf".  For
   example:
   <pre class='code language-abnf'>
   label        = top-level *4section-num
   top-level    = section-num / appendix-let
   section-num  = 1*DIGIT "."
   appendix-let = 1*CAP "."
   CAP          = %x41-5A ; A-Z
   DIGIT        = %x30-39 ; 0-9
   </pre>

   Is rendered as:

   label        = top-level *4section-num
   top-level    = section-num / appendix-let
   section-num  = 1*DIGIT "."
   appendix-let = 1*CAP "."
   CAP          = %x41-5A ; A-Z
   DIGIT        = %x30-39 ; 0-9

5.5.  Mathematical Formulae

   For now, just use an image (as specified in Section 3.3.4
   (Section 3.3.4)), with the alt text being a LaTeX [35] formula that
   would produce the image.  For example:

   Future versions of this document will likely favor SVG [10] or MathML
   [15] representations of formulae, if browser support and
   accessibility concerns are addressed.


6.  Security Considerations

   Since RFCs are sometimes exchanged outside the normal Web sandboxing
   mechanism (e.g. rsync to a mirror) then loaded from a local file,



Hildebrand              Expires January 17, 2013               [Page 20]

Internet-Draft               HTML RFC Format                   July 2012


   more care must be taken with the HTML than is ordinary on the Web. In
   particular, the intent with the format is to forbid any embedded code
   such as JavaScript as well as all mechanisms that could be used to
   execute code outside of the browser such as plugins or non-static
   media (such as video).


7.  IANA Considerations

Appendix A.  Allowable Subset of HTML

   This section collects all of the elements that are allowed in the
   HTML RFC format.  Each element is listed with a set of allowed
   attributes, and a list of the parent elements in which the element
   may be placed.  The attributes "class", "id", and "lang" are allowed
   on all elements.  All other elements, attributes, and nesting
   approaches MUST NOT be used.

   |                 | published as an RFC, it must have no changes    |
   |                 | other than formatting.  An example might be a   |
